# packaging/homebrew/smoke.sh — local brew install-smoke for the quorum-dispatch formula.
#
# The formula lives in the TAP (vickeryj/quorum-dispatch-clone-tap), not in this repo — see
# README.md next to this file. This script fetches that canonical formula and
# points it at a tarball of LOCAL source instead of its pinned commit, so a
# formula change or a source change can be proven end-to-end without first
# exporting to the public mirror and bumping the pin.
#
# It installs, runs `brew test`, then UNINSTALLS and untaps: the smoke build must
# never linger where it could shadow the qd someone actually uses.
#
# Usage (from the repo root):
#   bash packaging/homebrew/smoke.sh
#   QD_FORMULA=/path/to/quorum-dispatch.rb bash packaging/homebrew/smoke.sh
#
# NOTE: the tarball is built with `git archive HEAD` — COMMITTED source only.
# Commit (or stash-and-commit) the change you mean to smoke first.
